LangChain is a framework designed to help developers build applications powered by large language models (LLMs) more easily and effectively.

It provides standardized interfaces, tools for orchestration, and observability features that simplify the process of connecting different AI components—such as models, retrievers, and memory systems—into complex, reasoning-based applications.

In short, LangChain helps developers:

Integrate different LLMs and data sources through a unified interface.

Orchestrate multiple components (like agents or tools) to perform complex tasks.

Evaluate and monitor their applications using tools like LangSmith.

Together, LangChain, LangGraph (for orchestration), and LangSmith (for observability and evaluation) form an ecosystem that enables developers to build powerful, reliable, and intelligent AI applications.
